Model parameters vs weights -:
 Model parameters are random initially and are optimized using algo.
 Weights are chosen and are assumed to be optimal before even starting the algorithm.

Example of parameters - The number of hidden layers in ANN
                        threshold error in anomaly detection
                        'C' in SVM

Weights are the 'theta' in the algorithm.
In case of anomaly detection, mu and sigma.
